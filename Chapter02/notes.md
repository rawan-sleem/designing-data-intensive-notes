## Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages 

The choice of data model is considered the **most important part of developing software**, as it profoundly affects how the software is written and how the problem is conceptually approached. Most applications are built by **layering one data model on top of another**, where each layer abstracts the complexity of the layers beneath it. Since every data model embodies assumptions about its expected usage, choosing an appropriate model is critical.

This chapter focuses on comparing general-purpose data models for storage and querying: the relational model, the document model, and graph-based models.

### I. Relational Model Versus Document Model

This section compares the structure of traditional relational databases with document databases.

#### A. The Object-Relational Mismatch

Developers typically model the world using objects and data structures. Translating these application data structures into the rows and tables of a relational schema requires a translation layer, often referred to as the **impedance mismatch**.

*   **Relational Approach:** In the traditional SQL model (prior to SQL:1999), complex records (like a LinkedIn profile with multiple jobs or educational periods) are typically normalized and split into multiple tables (e.g., `users`, `positions`, `education`) connected by foreign key references to handle **one-to-many relationships**. Retrieving the full record requires executing a complex **multi-way join**.
*   **Modern SQL Features:** Later versions of the SQL standard added support for structured datatypes like **XML and JSON**, allowing multi-valued data to be stored within a single row, which is supported by databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, IBM DB2, and MS SQL Server.

#### B. The Document Model and Locality

Document databases (such as MongoDB, CouchDB, RethinkDB, and Espresso) utilize formats like JSON.

*   **Tree Structure and Locality:** The JSON document structure naturally handles **one-to-many relationships that form a tree structure** (where sub-items are nested). This approach provides excellent **data locality**, as all relevant information for the record is stored together, often requiring only a single query and minimizing disk lookups.
*   **Performance Trade-offs:** The locality advantage is strong if the application frequently needs to access the entire document. However, if documents are large, the database typically has to load the entire document even if only a small portion is needed, and updates usually require **rewriting the entire document**.

#### C. Challenges with Inter-Document Relationships (Normalization)

The document model is less suited for relationships that span across documents:

*   **Normalization:** Using IDs (e.g., `region_id`) instead of plain text strings for items like region or industry is often preferable (normalization), as it avoids ambiguity, maintains consistent spelling, eases updates, and enables better localization and searching. Normalization involves removing duplication, which is central to the relational model.
*   **Many-to-One and Many-to-Many:** Normalizing data leads to **many-to-one** relationships (many people live in one region), and applications inevitably evolve to require complex **many-to-many** relationships (e.g., users recommending other users, organizations linked as entities).
*   **Join Support:** Since document databases often have **weak join support** (e.g., MongoDB does not support joins; RethinkDB and CouchDB have weak or partial support), handling these complex relationships requires the application code to emulate joins by performing multiple queries, shifting complexity and slowing down performance.

#### D. Schema Flexibility

Document databases are often promoted as "schemaless" or **schema-on-read**, where the application code interprets the data structure. Relational databases operate using **schema-on-write**, enforcing the schema before data is accepted.

*   **Schema Evolution:** In relational databases, schema changes (`ALTER TABLE`) are generally fast (milliseconds), except notably in MySQL where the entire table must be copied. By contrast, the schema-on-read approach is advantageous when data structures are highly **dynamic, rapidly changing**, or determined by **external systems** over which the developer has no control.
*   **Historical Context:** The relational model replaced older models (like IMS, the hierarchical model) that also struggled with many-to-many relationships, forcing programmers to use complex, application-managed access paths (like in CODASYL). The key insight of the relational model was that the database's **query optimizer** should automatically determine the access path, freeing the application developer from that concern.

### II. Query Languages for Data

Query languages can be categorized as imperative or declarative.

*   **Declarative Queries:** Languages like **SQL** (or relational algebra) are declarative: they specify *what* data is needed (e.g., `SELECT * FROM...`) but not *how* to achieve the result. This abstraction allows the query optimizer to make performance improvements without requiring changes to the queries. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is presented as a declarative example for document styling.
*   **Imperative Queries:** Imperative code (like using the core JavaScript DOM API) requires the developer to specify the exact steps and order of operations to retrieve or manipulate data. This approach is inflexible and harder for developers.
*   **MapReduce (Imperative/Hybrid):** MapReduce is a programming model where query logic is implemented via two custom JavaScript functions: `map` and `reduce`.
    *   MapReduce is often less usable than a declarative query.
    *   MongoDB introduced the **aggregation pipeline** language as a declarative alternative to MapReduce, often structured similarly to SQL's declarative clauses.

### III. Graph-Like Data Models

Graph data models are specialized for managing interconnected data, particularly complex many-to-many relationships.

#### A. Property Graphs

The property graph model (used by systems like Neo4j) organizes data around two structures:

1.  **Vertices (Nodes):** Identified by a unique ID, they have incoming and outgoing edges, and a collection of properties (key-value pairs).
2.  **Edges (Relationships):** Have a unique ID, a tail (start) vertex, a head (end) vertex, a **label** describing the relationship, and properties.

This structure offers great flexibility and efficiency for **traversing paths** through the data (e.g., finding connections multiple layers deep).

#### B. Graph Query Languages

*   **Cypher:** A declarative query language for property graphs that uses an **ASCII-art-like syntax** to express patterns of vertices and edges for traversal and matching. These queries can efficiently traverse a **variable number of edges** (which would require a variable number of joins in SQL).
*   **SQL for Graphs:** Advanced SQL features, such as **recursive common table expressions** (`WITH RECURSIVE`), can be used to perform graph traversals.
*   **Triple-Stores and SPARQL:**
    *   Triple-stores utilize the **Resource Description Framework (RDF)** model, storing all information as three-part statements: **(subject, predicate, object)**.
    *   The subject is equivalent to a graph vertex. The object is either a literal value (a property) or another vertex (an edge).
    *   **SPARQL** is the declarative query language for triple-stores, structured around pattern matching. The semantic web initiative, which aims for machine-readable data across the internet, is closely associated with RDF and SPARQL.
*   **Datalog:** An older declarative language (a subset of Prolog) used for graph-like structures. Datalog relies on defining **rules** (derived predicates) that can be built up incrementally and recursively to form complex queries.

### IV. Summary

Chapter 2 establishes the crucial link between the data model chosen and the way applications must be built. It noted that the relational model was designed primarily to solve the complexity issues arising from many-to-many relationships found in older hierarchical models. New nonrelational "NoSQL" datastores largely diverge in two areas: document databases (for self-contained data where inter-document relationships are rare) and graph databases (for highly interconnected data).

The trade-offs inherent in these models, such as the difficulty of implementing joins in document stores or the performance cost of graph traversals, are fundamental to designing data-intensive applications. The chapter also mentions specialized data models like **full-text search** as a distinct model frequently used alongside general-purpose databases.
